Time spent on the project: 5 hours

If have more time:
- User can click to an area instead of click exactly the button to moving ( like google street )
- Lazyload the image, show loading effect when scene changed
- Animation process
- Unit test to maximum coverage 

Recommend
- In mobile, user can use finger to swift left, right so i think we dont need scroll left and right button
